## Introduction

Nouveau threads is an e-commerce site I built with Next.js, Tailwind, and Shopify's Storefront API. The site has been designed to offer accessibility and ease of navigation, with an emphasis on mobile responsiveness. While the Shopify backend makes inventory and payment management a cinch. I created this site as a starting point for upcoming e-commerce projects that I'll be building in the future.

## Purpose and Goal

[] Why did you build this project? Why is it important to you? 
[] What was the expected outcome of the project? 
[] What were the initial designs?
[] Any other preliminary planning that you did which helps build a narrative

## Spotlight

[] What is the “killer feature” of your project? What feature does it have that took the 
most work, or was the most technically impressive? Some possible examples: 
    [] User authentication 
    [] A feed of items fetched from a database 
    [] A particularly tricky UI element (eg. autocomplete, calendar, drag-and-drop) 
    [] Anything you’re proud of! 
    [] What were the technical hurdles that got in your way? Any major problems you hit 
      during development? 
    [] How did you solve those problems? What was the solution? Go deep here, and write with a developer in mind. 

## Current status

[] This section is optional. If the project is actively being used by real people, talk a little 
bit about the current status, who uses it, why they use it, what they say to you about  
it, stuff like that.    
 [] If the project was contrived specifically for the portfolio, omit this section. 

## Lessons Learned
[] What did you learn doing this project? Feel free to list multiple things. Also feel free to 
cover non-technical lessons. It’s great to talk about how you learned to use an 
advanced feature of a framework or library, but it’s just as valuable to talk about 
project-management experience, or things you learned about shipping projects. 
[] If you used a framework or other libraries/tools, was it a good choice? How did it 
help? In which ways was it insufficient? 
[] Is your project accessible? What did you learn about accessibility, while building this 
project? Describing how you tested your project using keyboard navigation or a screen reader can make for a really compelling story! 
[] How has this affected the work you’ve done since then? Real examples of how this 
project built your knowledge for future projects is fantastic.
