## Introduction

Nouveau threads is an e-commerce site I built with Next.js, Tailwind, and Shopify's Storefront API. The site has been designed to offer accessibility and ease of navigation, with an emphasis on mobile responsiveness. While the Shopify backend makes inventory and payment management a cinch. I created this site as a starting point for upcoming e-commerce projects that I'll be building in the future.

## Purpose and Goal

I built this project because I wanted to create a foundation for future e-commerce sites that I plan on building. This site will serve as a solid base for me to build upon, enabling me to focus on the specifics of each new project rather than starting from scratch each time. I believe, using Next.js, Tailwind, and Shopify Storefront API is a winning combination.

My goal with this project was to create an e-commerce site that was easy to use and provided an exceptional shopping experience. To achieve this, I designed the site with accessibility and mobile responsiveness in mind. For accessability, I followed the [a11y checklist](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/) along with [Google's Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/). For mobile responsiveness I used a Tailwind library called [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) to quickly design UI components. Although there are some quirks with this component library.

## Spotlight

My custom e-commerce site is its seamless integration of Shopify's storefront GraphQL API on the backend with Next.js and Tailwind on the frontend. 
This integration allows for efficient and fast fetching and updating of inventory data, processing of payments, and easy customization and styling of the website's frontend. 
The result is a highly performant, accessible, and SEO-friendly e-commerce site that delivers a fast, efficient, and user-friendly experience.

[] What is the “killer feature” of your project? What feature does it have that took the 
most work, or was the most technically impressive? Some possible examples: 
    [] User authentication 
    [] A feed of items fetched from a database 
    [] A particularly tricky UI element (eg. autocomplete, calendar, drag-and-drop) 
    [] Anything you’re proud of! 
    [] What were the technical hurdles that got in your way? Any major problems you hit 
      during development? 
    [] How did you solve those problems? What was the solution? Go deep here, and write with a developer in mind. 

## Lessons Learned
[] What did you learn doing this project? Feel free to list multiple things. Also feel free to 
cover non-technical lessons. It’s great to talk about how you learned to use an 
advanced feature of a framework or library, but it’s just as valuable to talk about 
project-management experience, or things you learned about shipping projects. 
[] If you used a framework or other libraries/tools, was it a good choice? How did it 
help? In which ways was it insufficient? 
[] Is your project accessible? What did you learn about accessibility, while building this 
project? Describing how you tested your project using keyboard navigation or a screen reader can make for a really compelling story! 
[] How has this affected the work you’ve done since then? Real examples of how this 
project built your knowledge for future projects is fantastic.
